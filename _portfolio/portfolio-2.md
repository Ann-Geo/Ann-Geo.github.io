1. Developed a distributed messaging framework (in Golang) for computer vision applications at the Edge that achieved 10.1x end-to-end latency improvement over the state of the art messaging systems. 
1. Developed a low latency in-memory distributed storage (in Golang) uniquely tailored for computer vision applications deployed on resource constraint IoT embedded nodes. 
1. Designed a WiFi latency controller (in Python) for an IoT video surveillance system deployed at the Edge that can deliver real time video frames to latency-sensitive object/event detection applications within a settling time less than 1.5 second. 
1. Built an Edge test bed for latency measurement (less than 15 microsecond accuracy)
1. Identified optimal keyframe selection policy for Edge video workloads that achieved 63.1% more efficiency
1. Determined the best scalable Edge computing infrastructure (with 64 nodes) for real-time video analytics using NS3 simulation framework (in C++)
1. Identified 630 unique image modifications in OpenCV that result up to 90% more object detection accuracy
