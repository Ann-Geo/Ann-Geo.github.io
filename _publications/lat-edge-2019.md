Multicamera based Deep Learning vision applications subscribe to the Edge computing paradigm due to stringent latency requirements. However, guaranteeing latency in the wireless communication links between the cameras nodes and the Edge server is challenging, especially in the cheap and easily available unlicensed bands due to the interference from other camera nodes in the system, and from external sources. In this paper, we show how approximate computation techniques can be used to design a latency controller that uses multiple video frame image quality control knobs to simultaneously satisfy latency and accuracy requirements for machine vision applications involving object detection, and human pose estimation. Our experimental results on an Edge test bed indicate that the controller is able to correct for up to 164% degradation in latency due to interference within a settling time of under 1.15 s.
